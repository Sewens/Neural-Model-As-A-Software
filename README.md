# Neural-Model-As-A-Software
The large neural model has obtained great success in the multi-area. 
Large neural models are gradually becoming part of the software, with more randomness and parameters rather than hard coding. 
This brings potential intelligence and more possibilities to software systems. 
It also introduces factors that compromise the correctness and stability of the software.

In this repo, we present the Neural-Model-As-A-Software topic. We discuss everything about how neural models become usable software systems, including these three parts.

* **Research&Design** How the neural model is involved into problem, including problem definition, engineering practice, and more.
* **Neural model internal** Discusses the intrinsic mechanisms of a neural network, about what it learns and how it is tested.
* **Domain Specific Application** Interesting and creative applications of neural model in different fields.
